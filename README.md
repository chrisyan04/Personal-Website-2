# Meet Chris
This project is designed to be an online portfolio webpage that hosts employment and personal interests attributes. 
With the use of basic HTML, CSS, and JS, this was created based off of learned material from the CSCB20 course taken at UofT.

The cover page is designed to be a creative intro to the webpage. Please click the bouncing image of myself to access my the actual attributes of the online portfolio. 

The webpage is accessible and responsive on small screens (ie. is accessible through mobile devices).
